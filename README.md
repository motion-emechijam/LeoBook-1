# LeoBook

**Developer**: Materialless LLC
**Chief Engineer**: Emenike Chinenye James
**Powered by**: Multi-Key Gemini Rotation (25+ Keys, 5 Models) · xAI Grok API (Optional)
**Architecture**: Autonomous High-Velocity Architecture v7.0 (Data Readiness Gates + Task Scheduler + Neural RL)

## What Is LeoBook?

LeoBook is an **autonomous sports prediction and betting system** with two halves:

| Component | Tech | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| `Leo.py` | Python 3.12 + Playwright + PyTorch | Autonomous data extraction, rule-based + neural RL prediction, odds harvesting, automated bet placement, and dynamic task scheduling |
| `leobookapp/` | Flutter/Dart | Cross-platform dashboard with "Telegram-grade" UI density, Liquid Glass aesthetics, and real-time streaming |

**Leo.py** is an **autonomous orchestrator** powered by a **dynamic Task Scheduler** (`Core/System/scheduler.py`). It no longer relies on a static 6h loop; instead, it wakes up at target task times (e.g., Weekly Enrichment at Monday 2:26am) or operates at default intervals. The system enforces **Data Readiness Gates** (Prologue P1-P3) to ensure data integrity before predictions. **Standings** are now computed on-the-fly via a Postgres VIEW in Supabase, eliminating redundant sync tables.

For the complete file inventory and step-by-step execution trace, see [LeoBook_Technical_Master_Report.md](LeoBook_Technical_Master_Report.md).

```
Leo.py (Orchestrator)
├── Startup (Initialization):
│   └── Ensure DB Parity → Bi-directional Cloud Sync (Bootstrap)
├── Task Scheduler:
│   └── Execute Pending Tasks (Weekly Enrichment, Day-before Predictions)
├── Prologue (Data Readiness Gates):
│   ├── P1: League/Team Threshold Check (90% Coverage)
│   ├── P2: Historical Seasons Check (2+ Seasons)
│   └── P3: RL Adapter Readiness Check
├── Chapter 1 (Prediction Pipeline):
│   ├── Ch1 P1: URL Resolution & Odds Harvesting (Football.com)
│   ├── Ch1 P2: Predictions (Rule Engine + Neural RL Ensemble)
│   │   └── Smart Scheduling: Max 1 per team/week (remaining vs Scheduler)
│   └── Ch1 P3: Recommendations & Final Chapter Sync
├── Chapter 2 (Betting Automation):
│   ├── Ch2 P1: Automated Booking (Football.com)
│   └── Ch2 P2: Funds & Withdrawal Check
└── Live Streamer: Isolated parallel task — 60s LIVE score streaming + outcome review
```

### Key Subsystems

- **Autonomous Task Scheduler**: Manages recurring tasks (Weekly enrichment, Monday 2:26am) and time-sensitive tasks (Day-before match predictions).
- **Data Readiness Gates**: Automated pre-flight checks with **Auto-Remediation** — if leagues, historical seasons, or RL adapters are missing, Leo.py triggers the relevant enrichment/training scripts automatically.
- **Standings VIEW**: High-performance standings computed directly from the `schedules` table via Postgres UNION ALL views. Zero storage, always fresh.
- **Smart Prediction Scheduling**: Enforces a "1 Prediction Per Team Per Week" constraint. The earliest match is predicted immediately; subsequent matches for the same team are scheduled as `day_before_predict` tasks in the scheduler.
- **Neural RL Engine** (`Core/Intelligence/rl/`): SharedTrunk + LoRA league adapters + league-conditioned team adapters. PPO training with chronological walkthrough and composite rewards.

### Core Modules

- **`Core/Intelligence/`** — AI engine (rule-based prediction, **neural RL engine**, adaptive learning, AIGO self-healing)
- **`Core/System/`** — **Task Scheduler**, **Data Readiness Checker**, lifecycle, withdrawal
- **`Core/Browser/`** — Playwright-based AIGO extractors
- **`Modules/Flashscore/`** — Schedule extraction, live score streaming, match data processing
- **`Modules/FootballCom/`** — Betting platform automation (login, odds, booking, withdrawal)
- **`Data/Access/`** — **Computed Standings**, Supabase sync, outcome review
- **`Scripts/`** — Weekly enrichment, search dictionary builder, recommendation engine
- **`leobookapp/`** — Flutter dashboard (Liquid Glass + Proportional Scaling)

## LeoBook App (Flutter)

The app implements a **Telegram-inspired high-density aesthetic** optimized for visual clarity and real-time data response.

- **Proportional Scaling System** — Custom system ensures perfect parity across all device sizes.
- **Computed Standings** — The app queries the `computed_standings` VIEW for live-accurate tables. 
- **Liquid Glass UI** — Premium frosted-glass design with micro-radii (14dp).
- **4-Tab Match System** — Real-time 2.5hr status propagation and Supabase streaming.
- **Double Chance Accuracy** — Supports pattern-based OR logic for team outcomes.
